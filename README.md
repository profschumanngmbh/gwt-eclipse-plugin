these are signed with a self-signed certificate.

* Nightly update site: https://plugins.gwtproject.org/eclipse/gwt-eclipse-plugin/nightly

## Development

### Importing
Simply use Maven to import all the plugins and modules.

* Use Eclipse Import and choose import with Existing Maven projects. Don't forget to select recursive import.  
* Select all the projects and import them. This will create the .project, .classpath and .settings files. If some exist, they will be overwritten.  

### Target Definition
The target defintion build is based off of the Google Cloud Tools. Follow their instructions to build.

* [Install the target.tbd plugin](https://github.com/mbarbero/fr.obeo.releng.targetplatform) - Install the targets plugin. 
* Once the plugin is installed, right click on the target.tbd file and set the target. 
* Note: The targets will have to be updated by setting the targets. This will regenerate the Eclipse target files.  

### Build
To build, Apache Maven and Java 17 are required. Invoke `mvn verify` to build and test. The resulting
update site can be found in `repo/target/repository` for local deployment and testing.

### Release
Creating a release requires signing artifacts. Set the following environment variables before running
`mvn verify`:
 * `SIGN_KEYSTORE` - Path to a pkcs12 keystore that contains a key to use to sign this release
 * `SIGN_STOREPASS` - Passphrase for the keystore
 * `SIGN_ALIAS` - Alias of the key to use to sign the release
 * `SIGN_KEYPASS` - Passphrase for the key
 * `SIGN_TSA` - URL of a Time stamp authority to use to sign this release
 
 At this time, releases are performed manually. The releases deployed to the marketplace will be signed
 with the certificate for `plugins.gwtproject.org`.

### Deploy
Releases are uploaded as zips to the [release](https://github.com/gwt-plugins/gwt-eclipse-plugin/releases/)
part of the Github project page, and also deployed at
https://plugins.gwtproject.org/eclipse/gwt-eclipse-plugin as Eclipse update sites. Releases will be
added to the [GWT-Plugin](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/gwt-plugin) page on the Eclipse
Marketplace.

### Testing
There are a couple of archetypes that are used to test. 

* [Single Module Mojo Archetype](https://github.com/branflake2267/Archetypes/tree/master/archetypes/gwt-test-gwt27)
* [Single Module TBroyer Archetype](https://github.com/branflake2267/Archetypes/tree/master/archetypes/gwt-basic) ([TBroyer GWT Maven Plugin](https://github.com/tbroyer/gwt-maven-plugin))
